main.js is where you will find the calls to the client and action endpoints. In order to use this with your environment, you will need to change the URL, client_id, client_secret, and audience to match your applications. These can be found within your application and API settings in your Auth0 dashboard. In addition to these changes you will also need to change the bearer token for the Auth0 management API to your bearer token. This token can be found under the API explorer tab of your Auth0 Management API in your Auth0 dashboard.
